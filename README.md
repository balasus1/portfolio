# Tech Wanderer
>The Tech Wanderer sought to abide With B.Tech in hand and Electrical and Electronics as core worth, 
>He ventured into the realm of IT, Java posters pasted on street light poles in 2004 did he see, 
>A failure in his path, a stumble occurred, Yet undeterred by failure's bitter taste, 
>The Tech Wanderer pressed onward with renewed embrace.

>He conquered Java's domain and JavaScript's secrets one by one, 
>Scala's framework next on his mind he built it like a master in kind, 
>ReactJS, SCSS, TailwindCSS then came, NodeJS too now his name acclaimed.

>Through this journey of endless pursuit,
>He grew wiser with each new tool he'd recruit,
>A tech titan now his skills on display,
>In his AI driven tech world he gradually shines bright every day.
